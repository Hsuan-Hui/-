Plenty of Advanced Warning for Supervolcano Eruption
許多針對超級火山的警告
There have been reports in the media that a couple of supervolcanoes, such as Yellowstone in the U.S. and Taupo in New Zealand, are on the verge of eruption.
The United State Geological Survey (USGS) says, however, that such an eruption at Yellowstone National Park is very unlikely in the next thousand or even 10,000 years.
Similarly, New Zealand’s GeoNet website says that the alert level for a Taupo eruption is currently at 0.
A new study led by researchers at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign provides some comfort, suggesting that geological signs indicating an eruption would be clear far in advance.
While there have been reports of seismic activity near a couple of supervolcanoes, the study, published in journal Geophysical Letters suggests that signs of disastrous eruption will be much greater and longer-lasting than anything that has been documented so far.
A supervolcano is defined as a volcano that at one time erupted with a force of magnitude 8 on the Volcano Explosivity Index (VEI).
USGS says such an eruption would not only have a devastating impact on a large part of the area closest to the volcano but would also affect global weather patterns, which would seriously influence human activity, for many years after.
The last eruption of New Zealand’s Taupo supervolcano happened 1,800 years ago and is said to be one of the largest volcanic eruptions over the last 5,000 years.
