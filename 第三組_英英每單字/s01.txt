Smartphone Use May Lead to Addiction, Loneliness, Depression
過度使用智慧型手機可能會成癮、孤獨和憂鬱
By the end of 2018, more than a third of the global population will be using a smartphone.
However, smartphone technology can be a double-edged sword. And it may lead to addiction, loneliness and depression.

Erik Peper and Richard Harvey led a study that has been published in NeuroRegulation.
In a statement to the press, the two professors claim that “overuse of smartphones is just like any other type of substance abuse.”

The two professors asked 135 university students about their smartphone use and their feelings. They found that “students who used their phones the most reported higher levels of feeling⋯ lonely, depressed and anxious.”

Peper and Harvey do not blame users for their technology addiction. They blame the “tech industry’s desire to increase their profits.”

The researchers warn that workers in the technology industry know how to manipulate our brains and turn us into addicts.

But they also suggest ways to fight back.

Erik Peper suggests turning off push notifications and other such alerts on our phones. These notifications activate the same parts of our brains that once warned us of dangers in our environment. And that is a problem. So, just turn them off.
The researchers also suggest taking control of when and where you answer a text or email. You do not need to answer them all. And you certainly don’t need to answer them as soon as you get them.

They also suggest setting limits on the time you spend on social media. Schedule periods of the day to focus on important tasks and do not allow technology to interfere.
