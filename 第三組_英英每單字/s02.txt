Facebook Feed to Show Less News, More Personal Posts
臉書新改變：顯示較多個人動態、較少新聞訊息
Facebook says it is making major changes to its News Feed to show users less news and more posts from friends and family.

The changes were recently announced in a Facebook post by co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg. The intention is to create “more meaningful social interactions” for users.

The decision came after Facebook was criticized last year for not doing more to prevent false news stories from easily and quickly spreading.

Facebook has been using computer algorithms to predict what material was most likely to be “liked,” commented on or shared. But Zuckerberg said that will no longer be the company’s goal.

“One of our big focus areas for 2018 is making sure the time we all spend on Facebook is time well spent.”

The latest decision was also based on the company’s own research. That research showed that when used in certain ways, Facebook can strengthen personal relationships and improve well-being and happiness.

Facebook said it cooperated with psychology and mental health experts on several studies that supported the findings.

Zuckerberg said even though he expects the changes to result in users spending less time on Facebook, he believes that time will be more valuable.

However, some social media experts have said that having fewer news publishers show up in News Feed will not solve the problem of false news spreading on Facebook.
