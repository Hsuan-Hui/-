The future prices of bitcoin increased 18 percent to more than $18,000 recently on the Chicago Board Options Exchange. The demand for bitcoin futures slowed the trading in the Chicago exchange. At times, trading on the site was not available.
Bitcoin is different from other national currencies that are supported by governments and national banks. It is not a coin or printed on paper. It is stored as a line of computer code. Bitcoin is similar to cash because you can spend it without using your real identity, as you do with a bank transfer or credit card. People who want to buy and sell anonymously like bitcoin.
Mining is the only way to create new bitcoin. People “mine” bitcoin by lending computing power to verify other users’ transactions. They receive bitcoins in exchange. The coins also can be bought and sold on exchanges. This activity is called a blockchain. It prevents anyone from spending the same bitcoin more than one time.
An anonymous person or group that used the name Satoshi Nakamoto created the first bitcoin block in January 2009.
Some businesses have accepted payments in bitcoin. Still, its popularity is low compared with cash and credit cards. Many individuals and businesses will not accept bitcoins for payments. Some well-known banking executives have spoken against bitcoin. Jamie Dimon, head of JP Morgan Chase Bank called it a “fraud.” But his bank is starting to use the technology behind bitcoin, known as blockchain, to more accurately track trading and assets.
