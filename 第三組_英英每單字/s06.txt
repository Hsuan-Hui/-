Stem Cells Help Paralyzed Mice Walk
幹細胞讓癱瘓老鼠恢復行走能力
A group of scientists in Israel are researching how to help paralyzed people walk again. They are using human stem cells – those that are able to develop into other types of cells – to repair the spinal cords of mice.
The results sound like a miracle.
The researchers put human stem cells in mice with damaged spinal cords. About six weeks after the surgery, some of the mice were able to walk.
According to a 2013 report by the World Health Organization, every year between 250,000 and 500,000 people around the world suffer a spinal cord injury.
People who suffer spinal cord injuries often receive therapy and different kinds of treatments. However, recovery is difficult and extremely rare.
Levenberg says she is hopeful that their research will one day be able to help humans. However, she adds that "these are very early studies, and we still do not know how it will work in humans."
Only about 40 percent of the mice that received the stem cell treatment were able to support weight on their back legs and walk. The researchers say their hope is that these kinds of stem cell treatments will continue to improve and will one day be a common procedure in hospitals.
