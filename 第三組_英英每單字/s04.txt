Facebook Adds Dating App, Launches Oculus Go
臉書新增約會功能 並且推出Oculus Go
Facebook has announced it will add a dating service to its growing list of new products.
The announcement came at Facebook’s F8 conference in San Jose, California.
Facebook has considered adding a dating app for years. But founder Mark Zuckerberg said he felt now is the right time to begin the service. He said that currently, 1 in 3 marriages in the United States starts with an internet relationship.
He added that the dating service will appear within the Facebook app, but users will have complete control over whether they want to use it.
Internet dating is very popular in the U.S. Facebook says its app will provide strong competition to existing sites such as Match, Tinder and OkCupid.
Zuckerberg said the dating app was designed with strong tools to protect the safety and privacy of Facebook users.
During his opening comments at the conference, Zuckerberg repeated many times what he considers to be Facebook’s main goal. He said it is to provide a place for people to build “meaningful relationships.”
During his presentation, he spoke about new products and services and extending some of the existing ones.
One example of an existing business product is Facebook’s Marketplace. Users can buy or sell goods on the app. Zuckerberg said Marketplace is one of Facebook’s fastest growing services.
Zuckerberg also announced the launch of Facebook’s new Oculus Go virtual reality glasses. He said the devices would be available immediately. Prices for the device start at $199.
The glasses are designed to make people feel as though they are in a particular place, without physically being there.
