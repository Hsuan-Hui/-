US Proposes Opening Most Coastal Waters for Oil Drilling
美國提議開放多數沿海水域供鑽油井
The United States has announced plans to open much of the country’s coastal waters to oil and gas drilling.

The Interior Department released the five-year plan recently. It is much more expansive than one suggested by President Donald Trump in April of last year.

The Interior Department proposed to publicly sell 47 possible drilling rights in much of the U.S. continental shelf. That is a large increase from the 11 lease sales during the presidency of Barack Obama.

Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke told reporters that the United States is, in his words, “going to become the strongest energy superpower the world has ever known.”

Zinke also said that he wants to grow the country’s offshore energy industry instead of having to depend on foreign energy resources.

Some critics of the plan have already expressed their feelings. The opponents include environmental groups and governors from coastal states.

When the plan was first released, waters off Florida’s coastline were included. However, Zinke announced recently that he is now banning oil and gas drilling off the Florida coast.

In a statement, Zinke said, “I support the governor’s position that Florida is unique and its coasts are heavily reliant on tourism as an economic driver.”

Last year, Zinke took a number of steps to make it easier to lease and explore for oil on land and in water. He removed some safety laws that were put into place after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010.

The Deepwater Horizon rig caught fire after an oil well explosion. The resulting oil spill was the worst offshore oil spill in American history.
